# Description
Pick and Go is a tool to help plan a trip to your desired city. This tool will allow people to be able to make their own “package” of all the attractions and places they like to go to in a particular city. If there are existing packages made by others for the city you wish to travel to, then you’ll be able to pick from the packages available and be able to rate and comment on them. This would contain an admin, a developer(can be anyone) who creates these packages, and a regular user. The user will be able to add the packages, store them, and customize them. This will help the hassle of having to try to plan a trip and allow others to share their experiences. This is a web app that can be accessed via the internet on a web browser.
